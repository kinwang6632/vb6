Hi,

Below are some puzzles we encounterd during setup connection to Nagra's SMS gateway.
We could not establish connection between our test program and SMS gateway.
Would you please help us to find out where is the problem. Thanks.


0. 所要連結的server應該是哪一部?哪一個process要跑起來?
0. 
   . Which computer that our test program should connect? 
   . Which process should be running in that computer?
   . How can we know the SMS gateway is nunning?


1. 所要連結的service為何?port為何?是否輸入指令svr emgr即可得知?
1. 
   . What is the value for "service" during TCP/IP connection setup?
   . What is the port #? 20000 and 21000?
   . Where can we find these port numbers? Are they system parameters in Nagra's s/w?
   . Can we use "svr emgr" command to know the SMS gateway is running or not?


2. 要建立連結時,是否應先送一個定義為device_call的structure到server(SMS GATEWAY)端?
	device_call的定義如下:

	struct device_call {
	  short int 	len;			//2 bytes
	  unsigned char op_mode;		//1 byte
	  unsigned char obj_name_len;		//1 byte
	  char		obj_name[32];		//32 bytes
	  char 		user_data[255];		//255 bytes
	}

	其中len是不是device_call中除len欄位外的bytes數? op_mode等於'0' or '1'?
	obj_name要填入何值? obj_name_len是否等於obj_name的bytes數?
	user_data要填入何值?
2. In the above data structure :
   . Is this formula correct? value of len equals to 
     (length of op_mode) + (length of obj_name_len) + (length of obj_name) + (length of user_data), 
     that is: len = 1 + 1 + (length of obj_name) + (length of user_data)
     Is value of len always equals to 289?
   . What value can we assign to obj_name?
   . Is obj_name_len equals to length of obj_name or just 32?
   . What value can we assign to user_data? Can you give us an example? Is the value in myProg.txt correct?
   

3. 如何確定連結成功與否?
	是否在write device_call之後,緊接著receive device_status這個structure回來,
	device_Status的定義如下 :
	struct device_status {
	  short int 	len;	//2 bytes
	  unsigned char	status;	//1 byte
	}
	透過device_status.status就可以知道連結是否成功?
3. In the above data structure:
   . How to know the connection is ok or not?
   . Is receive device_status statement should invoked just after write device_call statement?
   . Is it right?  If we check the value of device_status.status, then we know the connection is
     ok or not.
     In our test program:
	We receive a value of 0x0001 for device_status.len, 0x06 for device_status.status

	
4. 連結成功後,是否就可以開始read data?
	read data時,server是否將傳回之data放入device_answer and device_data
	這樣的 structure中傳回?

	device_answer的定義如下 :
	struct device_answer {
	  short int	len;		//2 bytes
	  unsigned char	code;		//1 byte
	  char		data[1025];	//1025 bytes
	}

	device_data的定義如下 :
	struct device_data {
	  short int	len;		//2 bytes
	  char		data[1025];	//1025 bytes
	}

	這兩個structure的用途為何?為何要分兩個structure傳回?

4. 
   . Can we read data after we setup the connection successfully?
   . When we read data from server, is server put result in 2 above data structures?
   . Waht is the usage of this 2 data structure? Why 2 but not 1?
   . In our test program, execution hanged here if we want to read 1028 bytes from server.
     But we can read data from server if we only read 3 bytes.
